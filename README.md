# cnn-driver-monitoring
This project applies deep learning for computer vision in a real-world safety context: detecting driver inattention states from images. It involves building a baseline CNN, systematically improving it through hyperparameter tuning, and applying transfer learning with pretrained models (VGG16/ResNet50/DenseNet).
